# Datasets used in this workshop

In this workshop, we will be using data from @wagner2016host, a study on the effects of plant age, genotype, and environment on the bacterial microbiome of [*Boechera stricta*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boechera_stricta), a perennial herb in the mustard family.
@wagner2016host released their raw data with the article and it is available [here](http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.g60r3) on [dryad](http://datadryad.org/).
This is a great example of how to share your raw data!

You can also download a copy of the data from this site from links in the descriptions below.
