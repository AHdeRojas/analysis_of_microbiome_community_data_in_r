# A quick introduction to RStudio

## What is RStudio?

RStudio is not R or a "type" of R.
It is a program that runs R and provides extra tools that are helpful when writing R code, kindof like how your operating system can run a web browser.
This workshop will assume you are using RStuido to interact with R, although everything here can be done without RStudio.
Most R users seem to use RStudio and we like it, so we reccomend using it.


## Installing RStudio

The main version of RStudio, which is free and open source, can be downloaded here:

## The parts of RStudio

When you open RStudio, you will notice a lot of different windows, each with some tabs.
This can be overwhleming at first, but you only need to use a few to be productive and the ones you need are similar to other computer programs you probably already use.

### The R console tab

The R console is where you give R commands and is the lower left window in RStudio.
It is the same way you would interact with R on the command line or terminal.
In other words, the "Console" tab in the lower left window is the only part of RStudio that is actually R itself; everythin else is optional tools. 

### The text editor

The upper left window is a plain text editor, like Notepad or TextEdit.
"Plain text" means no fonts, formatting etc, unlike program like Microsoft Word.
You can have multiple files open at once and they appear in tabs.
Depending on the type of the file being edited (i.e. its file extension), there will be different tools and behavoir, but its all plain text.

### The file browser tab

The default tab in the lower right window is a basic file browser.
You can open, delete, and rename files there.
Its not as well-developed as your operating system's file browser and is mostly there so you dont have to switch applications to manage files.
You can ignore the rest of the tabs there for now (Plots, Packages, Help, and Viewer), since they are usually automatically opened when they are relevant.

### The "Environment" tab

The "Environment" tab in the top right window lists the variables and functions present in the current R session.
It does not include the function/data in loaded packages however (unless you select a pacakge from the drop down menu that says "Global Envrionment").
When you ask "what have I created so far", the answer is in the evironment tab. 

### Everything else

Dont worry about it!
Its all useful, but not needed when you start, and some of it you will likely never use.


## R projects

"R projects" are an RStudio concept and are integral to many peoples workflow and organization.
An R project is just a folder that has a file in it ending in ".Rproj".
This file is created by RStudio when you create a new project.
Although R projects are not needed, we highly reccomend using them for the following reasons:

* They help with organization, since they encourage you to put all the code and data for a project in a single directory.
* They help standardize your current working directory. Each time a project is opened, your current working directory is automatically switched to the project directory.
* They store where you left off when you last closed RStudio. Depending on how you set things up, its as if you never closed RStudio at all. All the variables and files will be where you last left them. Even unsaved files. NOTE: It is reccomended that you do not rely on restoring variables between sessions, although RStudio will offer. 

Whenever you start something in R that you want to save, we reccomend using an R project.
You can make a new project by clicking on the upper right dropdown menu or "File > New Project".
