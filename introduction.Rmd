This primer provides a concise introduction to conducting applied analyses of microbiome data in R. 
It is not meant to be a textbook on statistical analysis and visualization of microbiome data. 
Quite to the contrary, we refer the reader to several
textbooks on analysis of microbiome and ecological community data `r citep(bib[c("caporaso2010qiime", "schloss2009introducing")])`. 
Likewise, this book will not replace books on ecological theory and statistics for ecological community analysis `r citep(bib[c("dixon2003vegan")])`. 
The reader is thus expected to have a basic understanding of ecological diversity theory and
applications. 
The analysis presented here starts after OTU calling has occured using tools such as QIIME or mothur `r citep(bib[c("schloss2009introducing", "caporaso2010qiime")]).

This primer is geared towards biologists interested in analyzing their
microbiomes This primer does not require extensive knowledge of programming in
R, but the user is expected to install R and all packages required for this
primer.

Why use R?
-----

Until recently, one of the more tedious aspects of conducting a population
genetic analysis was the need for repeated reformatting data to conduct
different, complimentary analyses in different programs. Often, these programs
only ran on one platform. 
Now, R provides a toolbox with its packages that
allows analysis of most data conveniently without tedious reformatting on all
major computing platforms including Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Apple's OS X.
R is an open source statistical programming and graphing language that includes
tools for analysis of statistical, ecological diversity and community data.
This primer is for those of us that want to conduct applied analyses of microbiomes and make full use of the palette of
tools available in R including for example the R markdown code for this primer.

Note that the R user community is very active and that both R and its packages
are regularly updated, critically modified, and noted as deprecated (no longer
updated) as appropriate.

> Any R user needs to make sure all components are up-to-date and that versions
> are compatible.
